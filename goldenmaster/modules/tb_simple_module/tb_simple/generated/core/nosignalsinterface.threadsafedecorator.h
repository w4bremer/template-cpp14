* @brief The NoSignalsInterfaceThreadSafeDecorator can be used to make property access thread safe.
*
* Each property is guarded with its own mutex.
* Multiple read/get operations can occur at the same time but only one write/set operation at a time.
*
* Operations are not guarded by default since the function logic can be too complex than to simply lock it.
* However, functions can be locked by just adding the same mechanism in the implementation file of
* the NoSignalsInterface interface.
* @see NoSignalsInterface
